## <!--📝--> Description
This project is a **Data Security Posture Management (DSPM)** platform designed to operate across two major cloud storage services: **Azure Blob Storage** and **AWS S3**. The platform offers the following key features:
- **Log Management**: Tracks activities such as file uploads, user modifications (capturing the usernames who made changes), and file downloads.
- **Search and Scan**: Scans cloud storage repositories to identify files containing sensitive information.
- **Server Scan**: Scans Windows servers to detect files that may contain sensitive data.
The goal of this platform is to enhance visibility, monitoring, and security of data assets across hybrid cloud environments.

## <!--🛠️--> Main Component Overview
| Main Component | Description |
| :------------- | :---------- |
| **🔍 Log Management** | Collects and processes logs from Azure Storage and AWS S3. Extracts essential information like file uploads, downloads, access timestamps, and user actions. |
| **☁️ Cloud Storage Scanner** | Utilizes Microsoft Purview for Azure and Amazon Macie for AWS to scan and detect sensitive data in stored files based on predefined patterns or user-defined keywords. |
| **🖥️ Server Scanner** | Runs scripts on Windows and Linux servers to find sensitive information within file systems. Automatically triggers scans and reports results back to the backend. |
| **🔗 Backend Server** | Handles API workflows, coordinates scan operations, processes raw logs, and provides structured data to the dashboard for visualization and monitoring. |
| **📊 Dashboard** | Centralized UI for managing and visualizing processed logs and scan results. Supports searching, filtering, and real-time monitoring of data security posture across environments. |
